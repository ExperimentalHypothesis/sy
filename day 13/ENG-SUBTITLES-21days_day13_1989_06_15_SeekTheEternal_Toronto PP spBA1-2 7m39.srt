1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
We have to seek the eternal.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:15,520
We have to seek the eternal and the transitory is to be used in moderation in its own limitation

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,760
and in its full understanding.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:27,020
Today's problems of ecology, this, that all these things come from human error and the

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:35,180
human error is because they have not found out the eternal.

6
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:44,060
When you find out the eternal, then you become a balanced personality, absolutely a balanced

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060
personality.

8
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,260
And the balance comes from divine wisdom.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:01,260
All the problems today are because human beings are not at that level of self-knowledge,

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:10,420
because human beings are still relatively living.

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,980
One person thinks this is good, another thinks this is good and that's how we exploit each

12
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:24,460
other, we exploit the nature, we create problems and everything repels on us because transitory

13
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:34,260
things as you know are transitory because they have inbuilt quality to get destroyed.

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:44,100
They get destroyed and gradually we learn from them how to destroy.

15
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,140
That human beings are the epitome of evolution.

16
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,380
God has created human beings as the highest creation.

17
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:04,860
Maybe we have been given freedom, a complete freedom to choose.

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,900
If we want to go to heaven, we can go.

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,820
If we want to go to hell, we can go.

20
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:19,740
So this freedom we have been acting on, we can say as trial and error and trial.

21
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:30,100
And ultimately a state has to reach where we start thinking, what mistake did we commit?

22
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,660
Where did we go wrong?

23
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:42,980
And there we have to realize that the eternal we have not sought.

24
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,500
We see this miracle, say, of flowers.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:56,420
We see the flowers, how beautiful they are created by nature, we can't feed even one

26
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,980
of them.

27
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:07,540
Continuously they appear according to the different categories they belong.

28
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,100
The choice, such a big choice.

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:20,220
All they send many others such living things are done by this divine power.

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,900
But we take it for granted.

31
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,380
We just take it for granted.

32
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:33,260
And the greatest thing that has happened is that today human beings are brought to this

33
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:41,140
level that now they have become divine computers.

34
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,740
They can become divine computers.

35
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,100
So very beautiful thing that is ahead of us.

36
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,020
Only thing we should know that we have to grow into that new awareness.

37
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,180
This is called as the one what we call knowledge.

38
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,140
Knowledge is not mental knowledge by reading.

39
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,940
You do not become.

40
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,340
Kabirah once said that by reading too much the great learned people have become stupid.

41
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,780
First I used to think how can that be?

42
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,340
Party, party, punnitam, urakabha, as to think by reading how can people become stupid.

43
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:28,860
And think is when you read all others are in your head but you are not there.

44
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,220
And this is I find today that we think by reading will become the knowledge.

45
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,940
Knowledge will be but that's not a absolute knowledge.

46
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,100
That's not.

47
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
That is a relative knowledge.

48
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,220
To get to the absolute knowledge you have to become something.

49
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,100
You have to become the spirit.

50
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,500
And once you become the spirit this knowledge is just manifested.

51
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,780
It can be manifested even in a little child and a child can know.

52
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,860
It's a subjective knowledge.

53
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,300
You can say but absolute.

54
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,260
It is not arbitrary.

55
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,140
It's collective.

56
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,780
You put ten children who are realized and ask them what's wrong with this person?

57
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,260
Immediately they raise the same finger.

58
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
This is the thing.

59
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,340
Now ask that person something wrong with your throat?

60
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,860
Are you suffering from some trouble?

61
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,940
He'll say yes, how do you know?

62
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,740
These children are telling me.

63
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,020
So only the decoding is needed afterwards.

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,940
That what's wrong with you?

65
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,860
What finger is burning?

66
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,420
What is the problem and what does it relate to?

67
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,580
You have to just know how to correct it.

68
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,300
And once you know the art of correcting it you can correct and you can perfect it.

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,140
It's very easy to master this art.

70
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,940
Of course you must know you can't pay for anything like this.

71
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,860
How much did we pay to the mother earth when she sprouted the seeds?

72
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,740
If it's a living process you don't pay for anything.

73
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,300
Living process do not understand money.

74
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:20,140
How can you pay for these flowers when you have to pay to the mother earth?

75
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,300
Of course you can pay through the florist.

76
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,500
That's a different point.

77
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,780
But to the mother earth you cannot pay.

78
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,820
She does all the job without any payment.

79
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,540
In the same way this is a living process and you must know that you cannot pay for it.

80
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,780
She who says that I'm doing God's work, I'm doing this work for emancipation of your soul

81
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,980
and all that and takes money, tell him that he should redeem his own soul first.

82
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,700
You cannot pay for it.

83
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:58,340
You cannot put in effort also because it is a spontaneous thing.

84
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:05,500
Sahaja means Saha with Jha, born with you is the right of this union.

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,980
You cannot pay for it.

86
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,820
For this you cannot pay.

87
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,260
Nor can you come on.

88
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,300
Nor can you demand.

89
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,340
You cannot ask.

90
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,460
It just works.

91
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,900
So it's so simple.

92
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,940
Now some people say mother how can it be so simple?

93
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,900
Anything that is white isn't it simple?

94
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,980
As soon as we are born we know how to breathe.

95
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,820
Who teaches us how to breathe?

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,420
Automatically we start breathing.

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,220
Anything that is important has to be simple, cannot be complicated.
