1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Without meditation you don't understand what is best for you.

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:21,080
So today is a day when you have to promise me that you will meditate every night, every

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,120
evening, maybe in the morning hours.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,440
Whenever it is possible, if you can go into meditative mood, you are in contact with

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,320
this divine power.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,800
Then whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society, for your country, all

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,080
is done by this divine power.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,240
You don't have to overpower the divine power.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,160
You don't have to order, you don't have to ask.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:03,240
Just if you meditate, you are one with this all-pervading power which is another great blessings

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,560
to us.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:15,120
Unless and until your Sastra is open, all the blessings of the divine power cannot come

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,160
to you, cannot.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,920
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs, you might get this and that.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,760
But your own development is only possible when you meditate and your Sastra is completely

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,880
open and open to truth.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:42,040
Now the truth is that this divine power is a passion, is love.

18
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
This is the truth.

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,440
They say, God is love, God is truth.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,920
So the equation has to be made, that truth is love and love is truth.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,520
But it's not a truth that as you have for your own children, you have for your family,

22
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,720
attached, attached love is not truth.

23
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,920
If you are attached to somebody, then you never see the bad points of that person.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,600
If you are angry with somebody, then you can never see the good points of that person.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:22,120
But it's a complete, detached love and that love is extremely powerful because whenever

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,960
you project that love to anyone, you'll be surprised.

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,760
The problems of that person will be solved, his personality will improve, everything

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,680
will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:48,000
But if you are attached to anything whatsoever, that attachment itself causes problems and

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,160
doesn't allow such to grow.

31
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,160
This attachment could be any kind.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,400
For example, you can be attached to your country, it took, attached to your society, attached

33
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
to your family.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,160
It can be of any kind.

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,400
But when Sastra Raya is open, you learn one thing is detachment.

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
It just happens that you get detached.

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,400
Though I mean you are not running away.

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,120
As it is in Sahaja Yoga, we don't believe in people who run away from society and go

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,680
to Himalaya's or that I call them as escapicism.

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
That is not the point.

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,560
What happens is that you are there.

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
You see everyone, you watch everyone.

43
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,600
You know everyone, you are close to everyone.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,440
But you are attached person.

45
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,640
It's a state of mind that you achieve when Sastra Raya is open.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,880
Then that state you are dealing with people, you are dealing with problems, you are dealing

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,000
with situations, but you are not involved in it.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,040
It's no involvement and that involvement which you had before can never give a complete

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
insight.

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,680
What is happening, what is the truth is about any situation.

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:22,320
So this detachment helps the greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:32,840
No use saying that, oh you are not affected, mother, so how can you feel for another person,

53
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,160
how can you have compassion for another person?

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,640
Because if you feel for another person, then only you can solve the problem.

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,920
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

56
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,680
It is not a real feeling because it does help.

57
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
The person is crying, you are also crying.

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,120
The person is troubled, you are also in trouble.

59
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,600
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,720
So to have detached in no way means you do not feel the another person.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:24,200
You do feel, you feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person, of the whole society

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,080
sometimes and of the whole country.

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,840
But that your feeling is so detached that the all-pervading power takes over.

64
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,360
First we must have full faith in the capability of this all-pervading power.

65
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,920
As soon as we are detached, you say you do it.

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Finished.

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,440
Once you say that you are going to do it, it's you who is going to do it.

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,600
Whole thing changes completely because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your

69
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,360
problems to this Divine Power which is so powerful, which is so capable, which can work

70
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,080
out anything.

71
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,200
So whenever you think that this problem, you are going to solve, you are the one who is

72
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,960
going to do it.

73
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,720
Then all right, the Divine Power says, all right, try your luck.

74
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:52,240
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine Power, it will work out.
