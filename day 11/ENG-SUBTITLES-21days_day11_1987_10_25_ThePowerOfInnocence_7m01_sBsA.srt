1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
So, actually we bow to innocence within us.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:29,260
And this innocence is the one gives you the enlightenment.

3
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:37,320
As I told you yesterday, the light has innocence.

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,520
But this is innocent without knowledge.

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,920
But your light is innocent with knowledge.

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,120
We always think that the people who have got knowledge can never be innocent.

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,840
Can never be simple.

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,960
And the idea we have got about innocence is that a innocent person is always deceived.

9
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:20,560
And be be fooled and can be always taken for granted.

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,520
But innocence is a power.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:36,200
It is a power which protects you, which gives you light of knowledge.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:47,040
The first that we have in the worldly sense is how to exploit others, how to cheat others,

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:02:01,800
how to make money out of them, how to make fun of others, how to look down upon others.

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:13,640
And the light of innocence is the light by which you know that love is the highest thing.

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:23,200
And it teaches you how to love others, how to care for others, how to be gentle about

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
others.

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,800
It also gives you the light within.

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,440
It's just the other way now of this avidya that we have in this world.

19
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,240
Just the other way now.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:51,640
The avidya outside teaches us competition, how to put the other person down.

21
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,400
Because it has fear.

22
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,920
It is insecure.

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,600
This knowledge is not secured at all.

24
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,520
If it had security it would not have behaved like this.

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,920
But the light of innocence knows everything.

26
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,080
It has no fear.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,960
When we say children are innocent, we mean to say that they have that power of innocence.

28
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,640
Many times people have noticed if a child falls from a height, it doesn't die.

29
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,840
While a young man may die with a much smaller height.

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,400
And the child is not afraid while falling.

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,120
He just enjoys as if there's a parachute coming down.

32
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Nice.

33
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,920
And then when he falls down also just gets up, laughs, smiles at everyone.

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,080
He doesn't understand why everybody is worried.

35
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Because in that innocence he knows that he's looked after.

36
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,120
He's protected.

37
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:25,360
He knows that there is a power which is much higher than him and he does not have to worry.

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,080
Then we start putting ideas into the head of the child.

39
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,720
And that is how he starts losing his power of innocence.

40
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,520
And he becomes a coward.

41
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,880
He becomes a cunning fellow.

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,680
He becomes an unrighteous personality.

43
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:07,720
But still we would say that the innocence of children is innocence of ignorance in a way.

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,000
Because they do not know the dangers of life.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,920
And the light of innocence knows all the dangers.

46
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,120
And also knows how to get rid of it.

47
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,720
Also knows how to be away from such a person.

48
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:42,640
That was a wise man who was going on a staircase.

49
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,920
There was a stupid man coming from the other side, foolish man.

50
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,880
So foolish people are always aggressive.

51
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,800
That is one of the signs because they have inferiority complex.

52
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
So the foolish man says to the man who was coming up.

53
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,040
He says one had to move one one side.

54
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,280
So he says I don't move for fools.

55
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
The foolish one says.

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:26,160
So the wise man says I do and he moved.

57
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,520
Once how the light of innocence tells you how far to go with a person, how far to talk

58
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:43,000
to a person, how far to indulge in another person's personality or his problems.

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,760
Otherwise he receipts.

60
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,800
He understands that this gentleman is a stupid fool.

61
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,520
So I move for a fool like that.

62
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,440
He doesn't pay attention to such a person.

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,920
He doesn't bother about such a person.

64
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,920
This is the light of innocence which gives you discrimination.

65
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:33,640
How far to go with others.
