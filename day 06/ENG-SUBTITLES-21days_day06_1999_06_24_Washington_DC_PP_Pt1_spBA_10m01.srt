1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,560
First of all, we have to know what is the truth.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,320
People are seeking, seeking, seeking, all over, but they don't know what they are seeking

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:37,040
and what should they get after their seeking.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,760
This seeking can lead you into many diverse directions.

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,800
Some of them could be very, very dangerous and absolutely misleading.

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,320
And many must have all of us so felt that.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm sure there are many who have found it out, but they think there is no way they can

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,640
return.

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,080
The seeking is very simple to understand that you want to know yourself.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,760
All the time you say, I want this, I like this, I, this, I like that.

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,600
But who is this, I?

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
What is it?

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
Who is this one myself?

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
What am I?

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,200
Do I know anything about myself?

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,960
That's very superficial knowledge we have about ourselves.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,360
Everybody has said, all the religions have said, you should know yourself.

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,640
There's no difference on this point.

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Actually in all religions, if you go in the essence, there's no difference.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,040
According to time, it was little bit stressed on one point and sometimes on another point.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,480
But the fundamental thing is that you have to know yourself.

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,400
How do you know yourself is the point.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,560
You will say, do this, give up everything, give up your family, give up everything,

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,120
wear this kind of dress, cut your hair or shave your head and all that nonsense.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,240
It's so outward.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,280
If you put little bit of your intelligence, you'll see, it's all outward.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,160
It's so skin deep, it has no meaning.

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,600
So what has to happen?

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,960
We talk of a last breakthrough of the evolution.

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,360
How do we achieve it?

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,840
When you are evolved up to the state of human beings, we have to know one thing for definite

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,840
that there's something missing within us.

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,640
Otherwise world would have been a most beautiful place, the paradise, to live it.

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,480
But something wrong with the human beings and what is that is to understand how we have

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,520
come through evolution.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:24,200
And as human beings, there are so many things of the animal stage lingering within us.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:35,480
The way we talk, the way we try to upris others, the way we talk to sort of dominate others,

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,240
one way we want to snatch everything, the way we are only worried about our food, this,

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:51,080
that all this is not really a noble human beings science.

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,320
These are all lingering from that animal instinct.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,040
All right, we have to accept because we are human beings, so they are to be there.

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,280
I think so much frightening.

44
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,760
But also we have one more thing that we think and we think and think and think and think

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
and think of ourselves.

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,120
Sometimes we think we should protest for this.

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,240
Sometimes we feel that we must become very violent.

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,760
All these things are coming from our human mind.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,520
Sometimes we won't be violent for something, just for violence sake.

50
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
They'll be violent, all right.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,400
But for their own purpose of killing some animal or something.

52
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,760
But here we have groups and groups of people who just enjoy violence.

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:55,440
This is another development in the human awareness, I think, that we enjoy destruction of others.

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
But also there is a seeking.

55
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,240
This is the sign that people want their evolution.

56
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,920
They want to evolve into a better personality, that they want to become something which is

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
complete.

58
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,320
Now how do you achieve it?

59
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,600
Now I must say that we have not achieved our evolution ourselves up to the human level.

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,160
So to achieve a higher awareness there must be some arrangement with you next.

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
And that is the arrangement we are not aware of.

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,680
And that arrangement is that within you is the power, it's your own power to give you

63
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,480
this last breakthrough through the awakening of that power.

64
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,000
Already you have been told about it.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,240
It exists, it's there, and it is the right of every human being to get his self-knowledge

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
self-realization.

67
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Surger, some is born with you.

68
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,040
With you is born the right.

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:21,280
And why should we not ask under fundamental rights, society, that we should have our self-realization?

70
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Which is your own?

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,880
It is there already placed within you.

72
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
You don't have to do anything.

73
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,920
Of course you can't pay for it.

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,800
How much did you pay for your evolution so far?

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,280
And how can it be different from different people?

76
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,920
Because in every human being this power which we call as Kundalini exists, whether he

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,240
is white, black, yellow, blue, any color, whether it belongs to North or South.

78
00:06:51,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Whether he belongs to this country or that country, they all have this power universally placed

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,920
in their Kundalini.

80
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Even if I say everybody has a heart, so why should we have differentiation?

81
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,120
But this mind, this human mind creates this differentiation and this problem saying that

82
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,000
of course they are not of our country, they don't belong to a group.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,800
And like animals again we start for getting into groups, groups of different, I don't know,

84
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
denomination.

85
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,560
Like some people have their folk and spoon put this way.

86
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
So they are one group.

87
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,360
Some people drink coffee so they have a group like that, is it?

88
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,080
We are very good at farming groups.

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,560
This is also animal instinct I think that we try to form groups of such stupid things.

90
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,440
And then we can have wars because we must fight.

91
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,160
We are a group, something great, so we should fight others.

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,120
All these instincts that are within us are inheritance.

93
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,400
They have come to us, they say it is in our genes.

94
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,520
Can we change the genes?

95
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,960
Can we transform our personality into something higher?

96
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,720
And for that I tell you there is a power within us.

97
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,920
All of you have that power within you.

98
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,200
And what does it give you?

99
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:42,600
It own passes through six centers, has told to you, it nourishes it, it integrates it

100
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,560
and ultimately it pierces through the last four-dened bone area.

101
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:54,520
We can call that actualization of the baptism and is connected to the all-pervading power

102
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
of divine love.

103
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:04,760
Again I say love, divine compassion and divine love.

104
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,360
So you get connected to that power which is all-pervading.

105
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,440
If you ask a doctor who runs our heart, he'll say, is the autonomous nervous system?

106
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Who is the auto?

107
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,680
Who does all these things?

108
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,280
Who does all the living works?

109
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
Look at this flower, it's beautiful.

110
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Who has made these flowers, it's different, different flower?

111
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,600
How does this mother differentiates and how she gives all these flowers?

112
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,840
Do we think about it?

113
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,960
We take it for granted.

114
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,840
All living work we take it for granted, but it is done by this divine power.

115
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Believe me, there is this divine power around us which protects us, which looks after us,

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
which guides us.

117
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,960
And also above all it loves us and it cares for us.

118
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,760
It wants that we should all receive the blessings of this all-pervading power.
