1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I thought you are all realized souls already.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How did you get them here, I don't know?

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Are they afraid of the Albert Hall or what?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I think we can try that again.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just put your hands towards me like this.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just take out my shoes.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You have to take out your shoes, that's all.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now as I said yesterday, that another simple thing is that you have to forgive yourself.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As it is, you know it's a fashion to feel guilty for everything.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know how it has started, but to feel guilty.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a fashion, say sorry.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Formerly on the telephone, we used to say, I beg your pardon, all right?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now does this say sorry? Sorry for what?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So this sorryness is too much.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now don't be sorry for anything here.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You shouldn't feel sorry in any way.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Don't feel guilty.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You have done nothing wrong.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Believe me, it's all nonsense that you must have read some novel or might have read some,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know what, but you have to feel guilty.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are not sinners by any chance.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Take it from me.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are not sinners.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's all just money making propositions, I think, to say you are all sinners.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You give us money, so all your sins will be washed off.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know, they also give guarantee card, I'm sorry.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So all these gimmicks, you must understand.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It has nothing to do with reality.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So just in your heart, believe me that you are not sinners, not to feel guilty for small, small things.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Our norms are so much that you can feel guilty for anything.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Say you spilled coffee, finished.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All your life, your bother, that I spilled coffee.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I mean, coffee is to be spilled only.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't understand.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So these stupid, non-sensical norms that we have adopted are really responsible for creating

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
this feeling of guilt within us also.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Also all funny ideas you read, the books you read and things you read, because you are on the way of righteousness.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are on the way of reality.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So you start saying, oh my God, I should not have done it.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's alright, forget it.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you have done anything wrong at that moment only, you should neutralize it.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But don't carry the load on your life on your left issue there.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a very dangerous thing, because you develop spondylitis.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If not that, you can develop angina.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So this is a very important center and don't feel guilty for no fault of yours.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So this is another very simple condition.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the third one is, as you forgive yourself for everything, you should forgive others also.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Because yesterday I told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But if you don't forgive others, then you are playing into wrong hands.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So just say, I forgive everyone.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Which is very important, because here people believe that how can I forgive?

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's very difficult.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What is difficult? Nothing.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone, finished.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Once for all you say that, and you'll be surprised, this center will open out.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Without these two centers opening up, the Kundalini cannot be able to through.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So just help yourself with these two things, just in your heart you have to say.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now in your hands, just see what's happening on your hands.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
As I told you yesterday, all these fingers are activated when you get your realization of vibrations.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because these are all centers of the sympathetic nervous system endings.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And in these centers, what you find is that these are centers on the right hand side

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
are for your physical and mental being.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Left hand side are for your emotional being.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So you can see these five centers, six and seven.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is the seventh center, which is here in the head, in the limbic area.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You have these seven centers and you start feeling on these seven centers, the vibrations,

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the divine power, to see that.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now once I'm just in Russia, I told you yesterday, has found out through his calculations

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and mathematical things from my photograph that according to him, I'm the source of this cosmic energy.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know what to say, but whatever it is, you just feel it yourself.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
One your fingertips, just feel it.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A cool breeze or a hot breeze will be coming here.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now you...

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Was this signal?

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No one knows.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
All right.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Put the right hand like this.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Through which the Kundalini pierces through.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You can bend your head better.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And now see for yourself, is there a cool or a hot breeze coming out of it?

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If it is hot, nothing to worry, that means some correction is needed, but maybe it might cool down just now.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Put your right hand towards me, bend your head and see with your left hand.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Not touch the head, keep it away and see for yourself.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can move here and hand from left to right.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you are not forgiving yourself or others, there will be hot breeze coming in.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It should be cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So now see for yourself.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's called as Ruh or it's called as Brahm Chaitanel.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now put your left hand towards me.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now put down your head and see with your right hand now.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Bend your head and see from your right hand.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can raise it, you can move it and see for yourself.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of it,

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
once more you put your right hand towards me and see with your left hand.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now please put both your hands towards me and watch me without thinking.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Just without thinking, you can do it without thinking.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now you can raise your both the hands towards the sky like this.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bend back your head and ask a question.

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Three of these questions, three questions, ask one of them.

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Three times in your heart. Three times.

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can ask, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Second question, is this the all-pervading power of divine love?

105
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Third question, is this the Paramak Chaitanya?

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Every one of these questions, you have to ask only three times.

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's all.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now take it now.

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on the fingertips

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
or on the palms or out of the fontanel bone area,

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
please raise all your hands.

112
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Sina, why God? See all of them.

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:49,000
May God bless you. May God bless you.
