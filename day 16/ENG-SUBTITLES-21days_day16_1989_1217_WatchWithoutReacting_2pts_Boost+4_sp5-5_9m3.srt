1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
In the West we have become very speed, not up.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,720
I have to bring down the speed.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:42,160
We have to use meditative process that we feel our peace within ourselves.

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:01:02,720
So the thoughts are bombarding our minds and we react very fast to others and to these

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,640
thoughts.

6
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:25,200
So one has to be aware, one has to be knowing what is happening within yourself, that the

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:40,660
thoughts are bombarding you, you are trying to ascend and you find it very difficult

8
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,040
to get rid of the thoughts.

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:02:06,040
The thought process can start by your conditioning or by your ego, only two problems.

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:16,360
And you are the one who is under the challenge.

11
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:28,820
So you have got these simple people in the village who start watching everything but

12
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,560
they do not react.

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,440
If you do not react then your thoughts will give up.

14
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:54,160
So the first thing should be to watch yourself that you are not reacting.

15
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:09,200
But you are experiencing and enjoying the silence, the subtleties, the beauty, the glory.

16
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:20,200
If you are being as well as whatever is around, you don't have to force yourself to

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:33,240
break this habit, but just to be on the watch out.

18
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:53,480
It's not necessary to talk too much about it also, nor it is necessary to think about

19
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,080
anything.

20
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:06,200
And supposing you see a tree, so it's a tree only, what are we going to think about it?

21
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,440
And whatever we may think about it is going to be the tree.

22
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,280
So there's no harm in appearing little bit stupid, doesn't matter.

23
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:29,280
But this is the basic thing is that when we start analyzing, we are breaking our own

24
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:43,520
nerves and poisoning our own mind and brain.

25
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:55,560
So to watch something without analysis, without thinking about it is reality.

26
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:10,120
If you can achieve that point where you watch everything without reacting, you are in reality.

27
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:22,680
And then only the penetration into the subtleties of your surroundings, of your relationships,

28
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:39,320
your friendships, the whole universe, dance upon it.

29
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:51,320
So to judge others, to think of others, what they are doing, what's wrong with them, about

30
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,720
anything whatsoever you may think is wrong.

31
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,240
It's not going to be corrected.

32
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:12,000
Like I know some people who are specially bureaucrats, they are traveling, supposing by the car.

33
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Then they will say, I think you see this road should have gone this way.

34
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,000
Or I think it would have been nice if this house was facing the other way.

35
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,400
But it's not, you see, it is not going to face.

36
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
It is going to be the way it is.

37
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:45,480
So what is the use of wasting your brain, your mind, your thought in suggesting something

38
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,680
which doesn't work out?

39
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,480
Never going to work out either.

40
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:02,880
So when we start like I think these trees should have been little taller, but they are

41
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,800
not.

42
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:25,320
I think that the crows should stop their noise, they will not.

43
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,760
So just accept it.

44
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:36,960
Acceptance is the way we are going to enjoy.

45
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,640
Acceptance doesn't mean tolerance because tolerance means you have to work very hard to

46
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,800
accept that the trees are of the same height.

47
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
They can't grow.

48
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
It's too much for you.

49
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:05,400
When you say I have to tolerate it, you see because my mind doesn't accept.

50
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,320
So acceptance as it is whatever you see, acceptance.

51
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,960
And that is how people grow I have seen, those who start accepting.

52
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,360
That's the sign.

53
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:27,800
That's the sign of their strength and their depth, like the propensity of this Mother Earth.

54
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:43,840
She is what she is and she bears whatever is there.

55
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:52,320
If you put a heavy thing on her, she'll put equal and opposite force and bear it.

56
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:05,240
She doesn't say I am tolerating it, I am exerting any pressure, but she's just accepting.

57
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:17,800
So the witnessing and awareness develops when we start just accepting things as they are.

58
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,120
I think it doesn't work out.

59
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:54,680
I think it would have been better like this just work out.
