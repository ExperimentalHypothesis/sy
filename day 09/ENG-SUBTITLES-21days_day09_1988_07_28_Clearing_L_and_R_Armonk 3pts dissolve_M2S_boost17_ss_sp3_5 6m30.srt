1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, it is important to understand the first rule of Sahaja Yoga is that you look at yourself.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How are you?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you really progressing or you are worried about other things like your business, these

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
are you worried about your recent or are you worried about your recent or are you doing

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
about it? That has to be the main object of life. The rest of the things follow it.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Once you ascend the whole cosmos can look after your problems, but you must ascend into

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the kingdom of God. That's the main point is. So, first of all, you have to ascertain about

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
yourself. Am I ascending? Am I transforming? Am I giving up all my bad habits?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Am I getting rid of my temper? Am I getting peaceful? Am I now sweet? Or am I now still the same?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Horrible, criticizer of others. Just put your attention to yourself and see for yourself.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's like a mirror. You start seeing yourself in the mirror. What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then you try to correct it. Now, second point is that you must see your vibrations.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What centers you are catching? For that you have to give yourself a bundle.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You give yourself a bundle and see for yourself what's wrong with you. When you give

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
yourself a bundle you will know about your chakras.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, then you have to go further. See, you find yourself that your right side is hot.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What you do is to put your right side towards the photograph and left side up towards the ether.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The ether takes away the heat. But what actually happens is that your right side gets

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the vibration and the heat is pushed towards your left and passes out into the ether.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, this heat comes from too much futuristic living.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Most people who are too much futuristic, they have too much heat.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And too much heat has to go away. And when this heat starts going away and you are amazed

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
how it works. For that there are various things we have to use.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But mainly for right-sided people they should not use any light at all.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They should not sit in the sun. They should sit in the moonlight.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They should read some poetry. They should not tie up watches.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They should not look at time. They should allow the time to pass.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And they should just become very emotional people. They should sing songs of bhakti.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They should not do hatioga. There are so many things they should not do if they are right-sided.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You will be surprised how people have been helped through this kind of a treatment which treats one side of your being.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The left hand side people are the people as you know are the ones who are dosai,

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,000
who bear up lots of things from others and cry and weep and all that time are on the loser's end.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Such people have problems also because all their organs are liturgy and they have problems of a liturgy.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Heart, liturgy, liver, liturgy, intestines, everything becomes very liturgy.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You get pains in the body. Right-sided person doesn't get any pain.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
himself he gives pain to others. He is very sarcastic, he is very aggressive.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He troubles others. But the left-sided people have pains themselves.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They get pain here and a pain there and a pain here.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So the left side is to be cleared as you know very well through the light.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Light is put before the photograph, left hand was the photograph, right hand on the mother earth.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So the left hand gets the light and the light passes through and the negative energy of the left side passes through the right hand and the right hand is on the mother earth.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The mother earth is the one who sucks in all these negative forces of the left hand side.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So these are the two sides which we clear. But once you have cleared these two sides then you can use the photograph.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sit with your both the hands or the photograph and put both the feet in the water a little bit of salt in it.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And what five, ten minutes you must allow vibrations to clear you out.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then wipe your feet, put the water properly into some disposal and then sit down for meditation.

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you can do that every day, even ten minutes is more than sufficient.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't have to do anything in an extreme manner.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In the morning time you have to give yourself a banda when you are going out.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't go out without giving a banda.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And attention should be all the time inside in the sense that walking on the road people have a habit of seeing this,

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
seeing that, seeing like that, the attention gets littered away.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What you should do is to see about three feet or four feet at the most on the ground and not above.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Because you can see all the beautiful children, flowers, everything.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There's nothing very beautiful about that.

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So better is to see only up three, four feet if possible to fix your attention.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So the attention becomes concentrated and you feel very relaxed and relieved

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
of too much of wobbling of your eyes.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Eyes are very important.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Very important and as you will notice because you are all realize so that your eyes now have got a glint,

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
a kind of a light in the eye.

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And that light shows that you are a real resource.
