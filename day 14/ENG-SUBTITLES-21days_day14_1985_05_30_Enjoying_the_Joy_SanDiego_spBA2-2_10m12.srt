1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
The first power that you get is that you become, your awareness becomes collectively conscious,

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,600
that you can feel another person on your fingertips.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,000
That means you become absolutely aware, like I went today to Mexico.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,600
Now I could feel the whole country, I knew about it before, but my attention was not so deeply

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
there.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,120
I could feel the whole country has a very bad left side problem.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,760
The left side problem is effective even this area.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,320
And the left side problem you can feel it very clearly that your left side becomes heavy

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,600
and you feel the heat in all your centers.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:20,680
So you start feeling the atmosphere, the country, the people and the indigent and yourself.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,000
So you know the problem of a particular place.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,160
When you may not feel that much in the beginning, you may just feel yourself to begin with.

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,640
Then you start feeling others.

14
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,480
So thus the awareness grows more and more.

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:52,400
In the central nervous system you start feeling the problems of other people, your own

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,240
problems.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,720
But it is not that you feel them as something which is painful or troublesome, but you feel

18
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:12,280
them as little heat or sometimes little pain, very little as if you are recording it like

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,840
a barometer.

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,000
And when that happens, you want to get rid of it.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,880
As if there your own problem.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,680
And if you know how to get rid of it, you can do it.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,680
That's what I was doing.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,640
You want to formulate something under collective.

25
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,160
If you are working on something, you want to finish the job.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,520
And then you want to attend to another.

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,240
Don't want to leave something after.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:01,720
For human beings it is difficult in the beginning because from human awareness you are rising

29
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,960
to superhumanness or you can call it to super awareness, into a subtler awareness.

30
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:18,440
So first the awareness is gross and then your awareness becomes subtler.

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:28,680
But with that you do not feel in any way uncomfortable or upset because you become extremely

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:39,680
powerful, such power of compassion that you don't feel anything, no pain, no problems.

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,960
The illusions disappear completely.

34
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:55,640
There's no more illusion in the mind like people say that when you face something, you

35
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,640
are feeling little pain or greed or lust.

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,200
But when your eyes become clear, there is no greed or lust.

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:21,280
But what happens that you start feeling the oneness, with another thing, whatever it is,

38
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,240
in a way that it is joy given.

39
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:34,760
Like you see someone an attractive person, there is no sensation of pressure feelings for

40
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,080
that person.

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:50,680
But the sensation just disappears and you start feeling the joy of the creation of that

42
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,880
person or the thing.

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,240
Like in Mexico people have made so many things with hand.

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:05,240
If you watch them, you might think, how much it will cost, what will be the price, who

45
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,760
has made it.

46
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:15,960
But if there is no thought, then you see something which looks very joyous because you can

47
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,680
feel the vibrations.

48
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,560
And you know somebody has made it who might have been a real ISO, who might have been

49
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:35,120
a very great devotee of God, might have been a person who must have thought that this

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,560
is your creation of God.

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,440
Such a person might have made with that feeling which is to be gratified and you feel that

52
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
we should take it.

53
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,120
The matter has only one capacity that it gives joy in giving to others so that you can

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,880
express your happiness into it.

55
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,880
So you become very subtly aware of the matter.

56
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,480
And to start understanding the matter, what it means and what is the use of a particular

57
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
thing.

58
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,480
In the same way, when you meet people, new people absolutely never know.

59
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,800
You know what are their needs, what problems they have on a wider scale, on a collective

60
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
scale.

61
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:38,640
And also you know one simple thing that there are people in Mexico who are seeking God,

62
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,760
who are to be helped, who are to be given something that they want.

63
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,360
They may not be so much aware of it, but we become aware of that.

64
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,960
And a kind of a report of a very subtle type is established.

65
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:05,720
And you get attracted towards other people not through any lust or greed or any purpose,

66
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:17,600
but in oneness with the joy that they have within themselves, the joy of the Spirit.

67
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:27,520
You look at them and you feel this person is such a wonderful person.

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
How do you know?

69
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,520
You start feeling the cool vibrations in your hand from that person.

70
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,160
And you just enjoy that person for that person, say, not for anything whether poor, rich,

71
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,920
poor looking, bad looking, doesn't matter, you approach the Spirit of another person

72
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,320
because you have become the Spirit.

73
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:59,320
People talk of big things, of organizing peace missions, this mission, that mission,

74
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:08,280
to create a better relationship, all relationships which are at a growth level, create problems.

75
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,680
Because there is some sort of a lurking selfishness behind it.

76
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,120
But once it becomes a spiritual relationship, you just enjoy the other person without getting

77
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:31,840
into any discussion about what is your gain, what is your going to achieve through going

78
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,800
nearer to that personality.

79
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:48,160
Once you become the receiver of the joy, like a leg which is rippling, which is absolutely

80
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:59,920
quiet and looks like a mirror, it reflects all that is created, rounded completely and

81
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,200
emits complete joy of the creation.

82
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:15,120
In the same way, the heart which is filled with the light of the Spirit reflects the complete

83
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,480
joy of the creation of another person.

84
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Whatever it has in a subtle way, you enjoy it.

85
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:40,520
In the time, you don't say, you go beyond time, you go beyond time, you are not bothered

86
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,200
about time, everything has got a proper time.

87
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,000
And you start understanding that this is the time it was to be.

88
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,520
You don't become a slave of time, you don't become slave of any habits.

89
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,160
And don't become slave of any temptations.

90
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:30,920
That you enjoy the complete freedom of enjoying the joy.
