  1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,400
So everything, the timing, everything has to be worked out according to the need of the

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,760
spirit and not need of the growth.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:27,480
When that happens, you hold slowly and understandingly the whole pattern of the Divine, how it

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,960
works out.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,680
And that is how you understand the dynamism of time.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,440
Because you live in the present, not in the future or in the past.

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
Actually, the past doesn't exist and the future has not come.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,280
We don't know what future is.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,360
To come in the present, you have to be the spirit.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,720
When you are in the spirit, then you realize that this present is the reality, the rest

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,760
is a myth.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:14,600
When the Kundalini rises, she passes attention into an area or she penetrates into an area

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,440
where there is silence.

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,280
Because it thought rises and falls on.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,760
Another thought rises and falls on.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,480
In between these two thoughts, this area exists of the present.

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:40,600
Now, but if I say, you stop at this point, to be at this point, you can.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,640
Your mind is jumping either on the past or on the future.

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:58,920
But the Kundalini is the only thing that stops at present moment, so that you don't consider

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,920
the past and the future.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:12,200
But you enjoy the present, the complete dynamism of the present and you are effective.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,960
You are dynamic.

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,440
You can do thousand one thing, which normally you cannot do.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,440
And you are surprised how it works out.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,120
The divine has its own plans, has its own understanding.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,800
And we cannot make the divine to work as we want.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,560
We have to accept whatever the divine does and manages and then we see the miracles of

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,360
the divine and we are surprised how efficient it is, how beautiful it is.

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:57,560
Like a machine, we feel the efficiency of the divine.

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,400
But above all, we feel the compassion, the love, the understanding of the divine.

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,960
But first we must rise up to that.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,240
And for that one has to grow in the awareness of the Spirit.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,840
If we cannot develop the awareness of the Spirit, we lose that magnitude, which we have

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,040
to achieve.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:31,680
So what is to be respected is the Spirit after realization, because it gives you the truth.

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
To understand the truth, you have to be the Spirit.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Otherwise whatever you understand is false.

38
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
It's not true.

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,960
Because of your mental projection, you think that that is the truth is not true.

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:58,560
For example, now, if I am sitting on this chair, you would know any time that I ever sat

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
on this chair.

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,200
But supposing there is a realized soul who comes round, immediately, he will know that

43
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,440
there was someone like me.

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,640
For example, I say that Mozart was a realized soul.

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
How do I know?

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,520
He's dead now.

47
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,000
Because we can feel it from vibration that he was a realized soul.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
I say Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul.

49
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,240
Not because the way he lived or what he did, that was just an expression or was the symptom

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,080
of his witness.

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:45,320
But because when you think of him, you get cool breeze in your hand.

52
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,520
Tremendously cool breeze, soothe, which crawls over you.

53
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,920
Oh, that's Abraham Lincoln.

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,000
We do not know where we spend our time.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,280
What people are important to us till we are desperate.

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,240
We waste our time catering to something absolutely useless.

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,440
And then suddenly we discover God, what a waste of time.

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,000
What a waste of energy, what a waste of money.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
This man was a cheat.

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
He cheated me.

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,800
This work was all false.

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Why did I waste my time there?

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,760
After realization, you become the absolute.

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,480
There is no relative value.

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,120
You do not judge anything relatively.

66
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
We just know what is absolute.

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
And once you know the absolute, you are a coxure about it.

68
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
There's no revering.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,560
Thus you become an extremely powerful person and you know the truth about everything.

70
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:04,280
Now the truth is very simple that you are the spirit and you are not the body.

71
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,760
You are not the mind and you are not the ego or your conditioning.

72
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,240
But you are the free spirit, just the truth is.

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:25,120
But it is not just a mental truth, but is actually so and has to be actualized.

74
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,520
The third thing that happens to you, apart from your awareness becoming the truth, the

75
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,560
complete knowledge, you become the source of joy.

76
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Not that you only receive the joy, but you become the source of joy, the source of

77
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:55,720
bliss and the source of peace.
