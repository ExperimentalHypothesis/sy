1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
We cannot enjoy anything in life, really we cannot.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,680
You can see the way people are now going on for such sensational things.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,480
The reason is there is no joy.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,960
The sensitivity to joy is so reduced that I sometimes fear with all that they are doing,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,000
say so fed up that they may have to put electrodes in their limbic area to get the joy

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
instead.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,840
They have become so very insensitive to anything.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,920
They will not laugh, they will not smile.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,800
They are so full of closed hearts and frightening things, whatever is said about human beings.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,320
Now first thing you have to know, you don't have to suffer at all.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,960
Secondly, you don't have to judge yourself.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,080
Let your Kundalini rise and judge you.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,480
You don't start judging yourself and condemning yourself.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,480
And another fashion which is very common is to feel guilty.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,440
From the very beginning you start, I am afraid, what are you afraid of?

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,600
You have to have all the courage, all the blessings and all the confidence.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,120
You are a human being and this is the message I want to tell you that you are a human being

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,320
and you have to be the Spirit.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,360
And once you are the Spirit, you will be surprised.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,080
The blessings will be showering upon you.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,000
In these modern times to talk about these things is out of date.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,040
But it is predicted that this will be said and this will be done.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,480
For us it is important, first of all, to know our own glory, our own truths and our

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,080
own thoughts about how we are built and how others are built.

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,160
Once you know that, first of all, the peace within is established.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,560
Unless and until there is peace within, what do you talk of this peace organization and

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,080
peace, noble price?

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,800
I have seen the people who have got noble prizes are the most hot headed, so much that you

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,600
have to talk to them with a barge pool in between.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,000
Anytime they have up to jump on you, you cannot challenge them, even talking to them is a

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,120
difficult situation.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,800
So how are they going to have this peace, foundation when they are themselves so shaky?

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:49,720
Then you have other things talking about the love, the love, full of lust and greed.

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,280
They love your course, not you.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,960
When you talk of love, love is a thing that is detached.

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:07,600
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to all the leaves, all the trunk, all the flowers,

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
all the fruits and comes back.

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,960
It is not attached.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,640
If it gets attached to one fruit, the tree will die and the fruit will die.

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,880
So this pure love or the divine love is detached.

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,680
That's why it acts.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,520
It works.

43
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,640
A person who is a realized soul is such a pure personality that even a glance of such

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
a person can do lots of things.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,840
Even a thought of such a person in the attention can do so many things, bring about so many

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
changes.

47
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,640
So, this is the time of our transformation.

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:04:01,760
We have to become a higher personality, the transformation has to take place.

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
And at the time of Easter, we give people eggs.

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,480
Perhaps people do not know why do we give them eggs at the time of Easter.

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,600
But about Christ is written in our scriptures that he was an egg to begin with.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Of course, he was much more before that, but to begin with, he was the God of innocence.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,200
But then he came as an egg.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:36,960
And then he was divided into two halves, the one half which incarnated and which transformed

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
is there.

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,640
So, the resurrection is the transformation.

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:49,160
I can egg if we are bound by our conditioning and by our ego.

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,840
We break through that shell and become a bird which is really a free bird.

59
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,640
Only thing the bird has to know how to fly.

60
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:05,540
Now, this is again I am saying is the living process of the living nature, of the living

61
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,080
power of love.

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
It is not something artificial.

63
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,120
In Sahaja Yoga, I must have spoken in this hall, I don't know how many times my before.

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
And again today there is a chance to speak to you.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,440
What I have to say is that it is important the becoming.

66
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
It is not important.

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
You cannot become a member of Sahaja Yoga.

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,680
You cannot pay membership.

69
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,880
You cannot pay for your realization.

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,760
How can you pay?

71
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,360
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth to sprout the seed?

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,920
Because she understands.

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,200
Because she has the power, she sprouts the seed.

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,760
If you give her money or read something before her, it makes no difference.

75
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,920
But once you get your realization, you start understanding how many powers you have and

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:07,360
the greatest power is of compassion and detached love.

77
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,720
These seven chakras are within us, which are to be enlightened by the awakening of the Kundalini

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,200
about which Dr. Spiro has already told you.

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,280
Now in the short time I cannot cover up the whole subject.

80
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,000
I must have given at least more than 1000 lectures in English language.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,760
But I would request you one thing, that forget about what you have learned so far, about

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
your conditionings.

83
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,000
Because if you had achieved anything out of that, I was not necessary.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,640
Now you have to see with a clean slate as they say, what you can achieve in this lifetime,

85
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,600
which is the most important thing is to be achieved.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:04,240
The highest of all that you become sensitive to joy, then you start seeing joy in everything.

87
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,160
You don't have to think as, oh, this is the thing which is marvelous.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
No, it just happens.

89
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,160
You see, it is.

90
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
Just you enjoy without thinking about it.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,320
You become a peaceful personality.

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
You become a dynamic personality.

93
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,920
You are not swayed by the waves of things like some fashion coming up, then some sort

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,600
of a nonsensical idea coming up, then some medicine coming up, and you treating yourself

95
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,320
and getting into trouble.

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,560
You just rise above all these things at a higher level, and you start seeing everything

97
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
as a witness.

98
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,320
You become the witness of all the jokes that are going on, and you just watch it, and you

99
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,280
think what's all this is just a play.

100
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,440
Many people have said that mother, you always laugh so much, and you have always smiling

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
face.

102
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,840
So the people are not going to take you seriously.

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,360
I said, I don't want them to be serious.

104
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,000
They're not going to be any serious, they're needed.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,320
What are you serious about?

106
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
You should be happy.

107
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,800
It's fun.

108
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,960
We have to be happy people.

109
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,200
We have to be happy.

110
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,160
Those people who think they are very guilty should punish themselves by saying, you are

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,000
not guilty, you are not guilty.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,560
Hundred and eight times.

113
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
That's what we have in Sahaja Yoga.

114
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,520
It's just a myth, all these are myths, we are working with myths, and making our lives

115
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,600
miserable, which is meant to be joy, happiness, and all the overflowing blessings of the

116
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,800
divine.

117
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,960
Whatever I'm telling you about, we have within ourselves all the great power, sicken,

118
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,760
of our brain, of our liver, of our heart.

119
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,600
They are to be enlightened.

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,280
And then in the light you see everything.

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,960
But as in this room you have so many lights, you have to just push in one button and the

122
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,680
whole thing comes down.

123
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,520
In the same way it happens.

124
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,560
But if I start telling you about the history of electricity in the dark and all about how

125
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,960
it came here and what all happened, you would be just fed up with it.

126
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,480
So what we are doing is to tell you that let us put on the button first, you better have

127
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
your light and see in that light if it is true or not.

128
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,320
If it is true you have to understand and accept it honestly.

129
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,520
You have to be honest to yourself, that is the main point I'm trying to tell you.

130
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,120
We are not to play about with ourselves and play about with our conditionings.

131
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,240
We have to be honest and to get to our properties that are within ourselves.

132
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,200
I'm not here to oblige you at all, there's no obligation.

133
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,880
It's just like a catalyst, I would say.

134
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,560
And you become the catalyst yourself once you get your realization.

135
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,760
And you can do all that I can do.

136
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
It's very easy and very simple.

137
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:30,440
May God bless you all.
