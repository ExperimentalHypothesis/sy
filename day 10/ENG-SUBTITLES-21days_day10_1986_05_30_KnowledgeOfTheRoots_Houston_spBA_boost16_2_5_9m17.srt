1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
So one must know that there must be something more we have to go.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,760
I would put it this way that in the West whatever knowledge we have had about science or

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,000
about other things is like the knowledge of the tree which is outside.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,640
Now whatever Dr. Warren has told you is the knowledge of the roots.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,720
Now supposing if the East has learnt this knowledge from you has tried to understand

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,920
this knowledge of science of course which is not very fruitful also but doesn't matter.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,320
They have tried to learn this knowledge of science.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,720
Why not we try to learn the knowledge of the roots?

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,480
The roots of the tree of life.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,160
Why should we not try to find out what are the roots which are to be nourished, which

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,880
were neglected and that's why we have problems.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,000
These are the roots within us which are being described.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,720
And when these roots are understood then only we will see that something more has to

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,720
happen that we have to feel those roots we don't feel them on our central nervous system.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,720
We have no sensitivity at all within us.

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,600
For example now supposing a person is getting mad he is not conscious of it that he is

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,000
getting mad or if he develops some disease he doesn't become conscious of it till he

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,080
gets some pain.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:53,120
But actually these centers are the subtle energy centers which give energy to the plexuses

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,000
and look after us very well.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,240
But how to enlighten these centers?

22
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
That was the big problem.

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,400
How to enlighten these centers so that we start feeling our roots?

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,680
For that God Almighty who is our father who is very kind and gentle in his all care has

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:30,040
made this beautiful thing within us and all of them are like the milestones of our evolution.

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,600
These centers are to be enlightened and when they are to be enlightened something has

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,680
to be done.

28
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,880
For that in the triangular bone here is placed the energy called the Kundalini.

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,200
It's a Sanskrit word meaning the coils.

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,000
It is in three and a half coils for a particular mathematical reason.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,400
A mathematician can understand three and a half is very important coefficient.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Three and a half coils it is placed there and this has to be awakened like a primule in

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,400
a seed to enlighten all these six centers and ultimately enter through this center which

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
is the sixth one in this order.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If the seventh one lives down below the Kundalini this is the important thing that has to happen

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,040
to us to become the spirit that Christ has told us that we have to become the spirit, that

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,480
we are to be born again.

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,960
It is again certifying ourselves that we are born again you do not become.

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Let us accept one thing we are not going to live with myths and dishonesty.

40
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,640
If we are going to be honest with ourselves it is beneficial to us.

41
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,120
It is benevolent for us to be honest with ourselves and to realize that by giving ourselves

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,720
certificates we do not become anything.

43
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,640
It's only a mental projection.

44
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,400
Whether I call myself a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu makes no difference whatsoever,

45
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,240
whatever dress I wear or howsoever I comb my hair makes no difference to me at all.

46
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,680
In all honesty we have to perceive and see to reach that absolute stage this Kundalini

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,160
has to rise.

48
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,640
There is no other way out and this is what is the Holy Ghost within us.

49
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,760
This is the Holy Ghost.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:51,000
Is the reflection of the Holy Ghost and Holy Ghost is the energy of God which is love,

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,560
which is His desire.

52
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,760
His desire is the Holy Ghost and is reflected within us as the Kundalini.

53
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:08,920
So the desire of God is that you should become the citizen of His Kingdom.

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:18,600
That you should enter into His Kingdom and enjoy all the fruits of His blessings, understandably,

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,280
knowingly on your central nervous system.

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,200
This is His pure desire and if that pure desire within us rises then we see that all other

57
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,640
desires were useless and they are not pure-righted because we have some desire say for example we

58
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,120
want to have a car or a car or they want to have a house or a house.

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
We never satisfied.

60
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:51,000
In general it is said that bonds are not satiated because they are not bonds, they are artificial

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,200
bonds, the real bond, the real desire is this one.

62
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:04,680
This energy of pure desire that says you have to unite, unite with the divine with the

63
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,000
all-pervading power of God.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,360
That is our pure desire and unless and until that desire is completed you may do any kind

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,040
of things, you may go to all kinds of things, try anything you can never achieve.

66
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,560
Now this is a living process because God is a living being, He is not empty words, He

67
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,120
is not just something like a dead book, He is not.

68
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:39,640
He is a living God, He is a living energy and this is a living process.

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,360
So it has to be spontaneous.

70
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,280
It has to be spontaneous if it is living.

71
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,640
For example there is a seed and you want to sprout it, can you order it?

72
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Can you mentally say alright it has now sprouted?

73
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,520
Can you say that alright I will read this mantra to you or Bible to you or do this will

74
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
it rise?

75
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,640
No, it won't.

76
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,360
It's a living process.

77
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,000
You have to place it in the Mother Earth spontaneously it will rise.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,200
You don't have to say anything, you don't have to imagine anything, it will rise.

79
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,160
That's what it is that this Kundalini has to be awakened in the same manner, in the

80
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,320
living process.

81
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,840
Now many people are surprised that I don't charge any money.

82
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,440
How can you charge money for love first of all?

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,120
And this love which is so spontaneous, I don't do anything, I'm just standing before

84
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,200
you, I'm doing nothing at all but if that love is flowing all over and if you get this

85
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,120
awakening because of my presence, I'm doing nothing.

86
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
It's your own.

87
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,040
Whatever is your own, this Kundalini is your own, your desire is your own and if you

88
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,240
achieve your realization, it's your own.

89
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,280
What is there to charge for to be honest, I don't do anything.

90
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,960
There's no obligation at all.

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,080
It's just a catalyst.

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,960
Then you become the catalyst, then the third person becomes the catalyst, everybody can

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,640
become the catalyst but one has to be honest and truthful.

94
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,400
Otherwise you cannot find truth.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,760
If you are living with myths, how can you find the truth?

96
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Now the modern Sahaja Yoga, what I call it, whatever the way I'm trying, is a little

97
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,720
different that people could have used before.

98
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,480
Like they first wanted to clear chakras after chakras, everything and then go through

99
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,280
all kinds of penances and all that and rise the Kundalini because people needed this

100
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
cleansing.

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,680
Now what I thought was the easiest method is somehow or other to raise the Kundalini,

102
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,120
somehow make it even a little glimpse of the light into people, let the light coming in

103
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,920
the lamp, let the lamp be seen by the people themselves.

104
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,400
When the Kundalini rises, you see, there's flickering say of the light, you can see yourself

105
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,840
what's wrong with you, which chakras catching, where is the problem and then it's very easy

106
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
to correct.
