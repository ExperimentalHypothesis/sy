1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
But with this power you become so much full of compassion.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Then your attention goes from you to others, what you can do for others, how can you give

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,160
them realization?

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,800
And suddenly you discover that around you is so many destructive forces, so many disturbing

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,680
forces, so many problems, suddenly you find a discipline.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,600
If you can transform human being, but it's no question of transformation, I would say it

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,960
is the question of evolutionary process.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
And when this takes place you find you are transformed completely and thousands have to

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,160
be transformed, thousands and thousands and millions and millions.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,400
But somehow America has a different type of approach to spirituality.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,000
They think if I don't take money then something wrong with me.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,920
I must accept money, they have told me so many things, some experts came and told me,

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,520
explained to me all the economics and all that which I don't understand.

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,920
And they think that it should be sellable.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,880
Can't understand this kind of a thing.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,840
How much will you pay for Christ?

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,560
How much will you pay for any saintly personality?

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,000
Because it is, this value cannot be, it's invaluable.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,240
Something that the most invaluable for you is to know yourself.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,520
If you have not known yourself, you are still going round and round and round in the

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,560
mad rush of thinking.

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:55,360
Even Einstein will be surprised, has talked about it, that he was trying to find the theory

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
of relativity.

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,360
I just can't find it.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,400
So he went into his garden and was playing with them, so bubbles and suddenly from somewhere

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,280
unknown, that's what he said.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,920
The theory of relativity dawned upon him.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,520
And he called that unknown area, he called them by a name, you see.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,640
And that name is rather to me, not so precise.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:32,520
But he says there is an area which you can exploit, by which you can understand for the

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,760
future generation, for the future scientist, where you get the ideas from there.

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:49,480
And he said for that you must have a kind of a personality that can perceive that torsion

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,400
area from where the ideas are coming.

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:03,520
If he can enter into that area, you can get the full idea as to what is reality.

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,440
He calls it cognitive, he says he is a cognitive science.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,080
And such a person can tell you so many things which, when you put it to the scientific test

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,800
you'll find is absolutely correct.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,800
And this is what happened to him because himself was a realized soul.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,760
And many people like Newton himself was a realized soul.

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,200
Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul.

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,640
But they could not tell about it to others because nobody would believe and anybody tried

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,360
to tell anything they just used to torture them.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,120
Every saint has real say in Tamil, has been tortured, every sushi has been tortured.

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,840
In our country especially many saints have been very badly treated.

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
Also in other countries, why?

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,160
Because they are only one and maybe people were jealous that how could they know so much,

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,520
how could they talk about so many things.

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,840
Now with all this, now only thing if I have done anything is very simple that I thought

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,880
no use giving this realization to one or two persons which was the tradition to give to

50
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,360
only one to one.

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,840
But now I felt it won't work out.

52
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,960
We have to have it for the masses.

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,920
And I just what I did was to find out a method by which I can give our mass realization.

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
That's all.

55
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,520
Which is a simple thing.

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,960
And that is working and it's work very well.

57
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,840
As I said in America they just think of this another achievement of human beings that

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
they know about money.

59
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,120
So money, money, money, everything money.

60
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,840
So they can't understand even spirituality without money.

61
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,520
But in a place like, say we can say Russia.

62
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,000
Russia people, Russian people had no freedom as you have.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,040
And they had oppression from all sides in there.

64
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,400
As you know the whole thing was a, was a communist country.

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,840
And in that communism they were completely oppressed.

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,960
So as a result they went inside, gave us.

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,560
And tried to find out solutions inside.

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,040
So when they saw me just seeing me, I don't know how thousands of them came.

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,800
Now we are thousands and thousands and thousands of people in Russia alone.

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,720
So in other some countries.

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,960
I mean, I mean I see here, I'm just thinking in Russia we have to take.

72
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,120
We cannot put it in a hall where we have to have a big tent or Olympics where they had

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,400
some sort of a thing like that.

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,520
So the trouble is we should give up this idea that I can find it for myself.

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
This is very, very common.

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,280
You cannot.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,160
This is the only evolution in which you have to get it from an enlightened person.

78
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
You have to humble on this point.

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,920
But I can't get it on my own.

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,440
I can find my own way.

81
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
You cannot.

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,080
You'll be lost.

83
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,760
You have to have somebody who is already enlightened.

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,680
Now how to get an enlightened person also?

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
How to know?

86
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Because after realization you know the absolute truth.

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,920
On your fingertips you can feel the centers of other person.

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,760
If something is fishy you can feel it.

89
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,600
If somebody is cheating you can feel it.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Everything.

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Your fingers speak.

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,440
This is what Momasabha said at the time of resurrection your hands will speak.

93
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Clearly.

94
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,200
How can hands speak?

95
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
This is how?

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:33,760
And all these five fingers are the centers, sixth and seventh centers.
