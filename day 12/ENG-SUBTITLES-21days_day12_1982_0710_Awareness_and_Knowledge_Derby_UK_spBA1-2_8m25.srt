1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
There has been never such confusion in the minds of human beings as it is today, as to the

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,500
right or wrong.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Never so much.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,780
Whatever was said, this was not good they would do.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,860
Knowingly that they are doing wrong.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,920
If they were good people they would say, all right, this is good, we'll do the good.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,460
But everybody knew that this was wrong or right.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,100
They may do it.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,780
And today no one knows what is wrong and what is right.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,220
Apart from wrong and right, it's much beyond that you have to know yourself.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,220
Because this awareness is within us that we do not know ourselves.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,740
We do not know the absolute.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,620
We live in a relative world.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,980
Of this everybody seems to be conscious, maybe in the subconscious or maybe in the unconscious.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,460
But definitely there's a feeling in every one of us that we do not know.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:04,180
And it's a very honest feeling, it's a very sublime feeling that we have to know something

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
more.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,940
Now when we say the word no, we think, as if I would say, I don't know about the Bishar,

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,780
I've never been there.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,140
Now this means what?

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,420
I don't know about the Bishar.

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,940
We don't know about the Bishar, I can read it in the books, I can find out.

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,260
I can know all the history of Derbyshire, I can find out who are the people who will,

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,460
who are making beautiful porcelain here, I can find out all about their history, everything

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,780
I can read about it.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,780
Still why should I say I don't know anything about Derbyshire?

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,140
Because I have not been to Derbyshire before.

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,100
I have not been to Derby, I have not been to this area, I have not seen this place, I have

29
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,100
not visited it.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,780
I have had no experience of this place, so I don't know about it.

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,620
This is exactly what is the situation.

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,500
The situation is that we do not know about the Divine, we have read about it, we have heard

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,020
about it.

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,540
So many people have written about it, once they know there's an inquiry about it, they

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,340
come out with books, books after books, thousands of books have written.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,660
How many of them are true and how many of them are untrue?

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,060
It is impossible to find out.

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,580
Because we do not actually know.

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,300
Supposing somebody says that Duke of Bedford was born in Derbyshire, all right, how will

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
I know?

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,500
I would not know till I meet somebody who is really belonging to that place who knows

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,780
about it.

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,340
In the same way the knowledge that we have also about Divine is very confusing.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,540
But this is not knowledge, this is never the knowledge.

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:55,460
The idea of knowledge comes to us as if it is a kind of an answer to our inquiries which

46
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,940
is rational, which we can understand intelligently through our intelligence.

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,500
But now this area is beyond intelligence, beyond rationality.

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,260
Beyond all that is limited, it's the unlimited area.

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,100
Such unlimited areas can be only known by experience of your awareness.

50
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,460
Now this one should understand is a very delicate thing, how to know something and experience

51
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,420
of our awareness.

52
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,460
Not an experience, they certainly see a light, so it's an experience.

53
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,660
I mean you can always see a light, it's so great.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,860
People feel about it that they have seen some light suddenly sparking before them.

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Nothing's so great.

56
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,620
It can be some area from there as sparking can come and maybe it is of no use to you,

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,380
but just you might feel that you have experienced.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,620
So one must know that seeing is not experiencing.

59
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,700
For example a dog sees this instrument.

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,980
But what does he know about it?

61
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,860
He sees it.

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:15,020
Awareness, the human awareness has so many great things about itself compared to the animal

63
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,620
awareness.

64
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:26,460
For example we can say the awareness of beauty, animal's don't have, awareness of cleanliness,

65
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,740
animals don't have.

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,340
Human beings have these built within themselves.

67
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,900
They can feel it.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,300
They can feel it on the central nervous system.

69
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,300
So whatever is your awareness is to be felt on your central nervous system.

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,660
It's not just an imaginary thing or an intellectual discussion.

71
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,700
I say, yes I know, I don't, not that.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,140
The knowledge should come to you through your feelings.

73
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:04,900
Like I can feel this is hot or cold, but a stone will not feel anything.

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,780
In the same way the feeling has to come through your central nervous system.

75
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,940
That means your awareness itself is to be going, it has to be charged.

76
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,140
It has to get a new dimension.

77
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,860
Your awareness itself has to get a new dimension.

78
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,460
All other experiences has no meaning whatsoever in evolution if you see.

79
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:33,420
In evolutionary process it is the awareness that improves, receives better and better

80
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,980
dimensions.

81
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,220
And these dimensions have reached its maximum at the time when you become a human being,

82
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:49,700
where your awareness is just ready to receive the awareness of the universal being, of

83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,180
the collective being, so that you become the collective being.

84
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,140
Now I would like to tell you about this within ourselves how we are placed.

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:06,580
For every practical purposes you should not take me for granted, but you should not

86
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,940
also deny what I tell you.

87
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:17,140
It's like entering into a new university, we listen to the professor and we try to follow

88
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
him.

89
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:26,420
Supposing he propounded, he propounds a hypothesis before you.

90
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,020
When you just start judging it, work it out.

91
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:39,460
If it is true then you call it a law.

92
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:49,020
In the same way we should enter into this new understanding by first seeing it, not denying

93
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,580
it, then if it is true then we have to believe it.

94
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,740
There should be no blind faith about Sahaja Yoga.

95
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,340
Blind faith does not help at all.

96
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,580
Neither there should be a denial and with that cheerful attitude, if you just listen to

97
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,260
me as a hypothesis, whatever I am telling you, you need not accept it as to just now.

98
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,220
But then the time has come for me to prove the truth to you and the truth can be proved

99
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,820
to you.

100
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:26,660
When has come to prove the existence of God, to prove, not prove that I give you a big

101
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,860
lecture or take you to courts or some sort of a thing like that, but how am I going to

102
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,300
prove it on your awareness?

103
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:46,740
It is going to be absolute experience of your awareness that you are going to feel God

104
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,420
almighty.

105
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:56,060
Time has come to prove the scriptures, all the scriptures.

106
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:04,740
The time has come to prove your own connection with God, your own relationship with Him,

107
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,460
your own relationship with that primordial being, whether you call it God or anything

108
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,140
I, it makes no difference to God Himself.

109
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:19,100
Whether you call Him by any name, there is God and that God is not the way you conceive

110
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
God.

111
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:49,660
Today you understand God or you know God, but is the God as He is.
