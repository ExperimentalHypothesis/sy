1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,080
The mind about which we speak and depend upon is a myth.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,080
There's nothing like mind.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
Brain is reality, not the mind.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,360
Mind is created by us reacting to outside.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,280
Either we react to conditioning or to our ego.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,040
Does this mind is created like bubbles on the ocean of reality?

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,880
But that's not reality.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:52,800
With this mind, whatever we decide, we know is very limited, elusive and sometimes shocking.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,760
The mind always moves in a linear direction.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,280
And because there's no reality in it, it recoils and boom rags.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:18,560
Does all the enterprises, all the projections so far we have gone, it seems come back to us.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Whatever they discover comes back to us as a big destructive power or a very big shock.

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:38,680
So one has to decide what to do, how to be out of this trap of our mind.

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:48,760
Kundalini is the solution when she's awake, she takes you, that awakely, she takes you beyond

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
your mind.

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,640
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,120
With mind you will do many things, but it will not be satisfying, it will be not a solution,

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
it will not hurt her.

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,160
And when we start depending too much on our mind, we develop all kinds of physical

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,760
and emotional problems.

21
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,360
Now the latest is the stress.

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Stress and the stress has no solution they say.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,440
But in Sahaja Yoga we find the solution.

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:32,880
By crossing over this mind, it's like a barrier for our advancement.

25
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:41,120
So when you get your realization you must understand that your Kundalini has taken your

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
attention beyond the mind.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:53,200
Now this reaction to outside has come because we human beings have a rhythm like, or we

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
can say, prism like, skull.

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,360
And when the energy passes into it, I'll explain it in my books.

30
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:12,320
It goes into bifurcations or you can say, reflections by which our attention goes out and we react.

31
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,800
If we react too much, then these bubbles create a very horrible mind which can lead to any

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
kind of thing.

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,040
It justifies itself its temposir ego.

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:39,640
The ego and the conditioning that creates this mind starts using and this mind for the

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:52,760
purpose of their fulfillment of their, all the accumulation of ideas and thoughts which

36
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,920
has no backing, which has no reality to it.

37
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:06,120
Just like we make the computer, ultimately we become slaves of the computer, we make

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,080
the watches ourselves and then we become slaves of the watches.

39
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,680
That's how it dominates human beings.

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:24,520
And when a person who has a very strong mind decides to destroy like Hitler did with

41
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:32,680
some idea, he can't go on destroying which has a very far-fished effect on our culture,

42
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,160
on our spirituality.

43
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly aware where you cross your mind, you go

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,600
above your mind.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Mind cannot affect.

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,920
This is the first stage as we call it, thoughtless awareness.

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,520
Second one is where you see, start seeing the working of this paravasaitanya, of this

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:10,200
all-pervading power and you start becoming aware that there is lot of truth in what

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,760
Mahpatici says, that there is this power which works out many things.

50
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,600
It works miraculously so many things for you.

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,080
It gives you blessing, it guides you, it helps you in so many ways it helps.

52
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:37,720
It gives you good health, good wealth and also a very good society of very beautiful people

53
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,440
in the collect.

54
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,320
All that you can see clearly is happening here.

55
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:52,080
There are a lot of questions.

56
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:07,040
Now this happening of achieving thoughtless awareness is very simple and easy but to

57
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:15,800
maintain at that point is difficult.

58
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:27,120
Anything you see you react to get to that point in thoughtless awareness is first to change

59
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
your attention.

60
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:38,720
Now for example, once we were climbing a very high mountain to see one temple called

61
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,600
palitana, myself, my son-in-law and my daughter.

62
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,960
I was really tired because we had to climb I don't know how many steps.

63
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,640
And when we went up we were tired and there was a little canopy made of beautiful marble

64
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,360
carving so we just lay down there.

65
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,960
They were very tired and they said, what is this kind of a temple, a dressing?

66
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:12,280
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful elephants were caught.

67
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,520
So I told my son-in-law, look at these elephants.

68
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,560
They all have takes of different types.

69
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,800
He said, mummy, they are all dying, how can you see the tails of elephants?

70
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,600
What is just to divert their attention from that darkness, I told them that why not see

71
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,680
these tails of the elephant which is very different?

72
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:49,080
So what happens that when you are putting your attention so much to outside all the time,

73
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,960
then you must first of all also divert your attention.

74
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,760
For example, you see these beautifully made things here.

75
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,600
Your attention is something else just try to enjoy the beauty of that.

76
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:10,200
They are a beautiful carpets, just look at them without thinking because they don't belong

77
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,920
to you so no headache, they belong to somebody else.

78
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
It's very good.

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Otherwise if it belongs to you, you start thinking, oh my God, I spread in the mirror, what

80
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
will happen there to be scared or something like that.

81
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,120
That's common human reaction.

82
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,720
But if it doesn't belong to you, you can watch it nicely.

83
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Now you watch it and don't think.

84
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,800
You'll be amazed when you see the beauty that is put inside this.

85
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,960
You'll see the artist who has put his joy is exuberance in it.

86
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:52,200
And it will be amazed after realization that this exuberance will fill into you and a cool

87
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,080
kind of relaxation will come into you.

88
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,760
And this Kundalini will rise and it will become steady in your thoughtlessness.

89
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:13,200
So whenever you look at anything, look at any beautiful thing, even say to the exuberance,

90
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,240
just watch the man who is the exuberant.

91
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,200
Watching him itself gives him blessings, gives him better ideas.

92
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,760
You get also ideas which are coming from reality, which are there.

93
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:38,360
How to make this man a successful person or this country a successful democracy?

94
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:50,240
All these things happen when your attention is diverted from criticizing, from reacting

95
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,960
just you watch, become the witness, try to be the witness of it.

96
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not so very yet practiced so far as we, that whenever even we get our continued

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,200
realization, we don't realize that we have to be dissatisfied.

98
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,520
When you start to test it through your spirit, then you don't see the bad points of another,

99
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
that you see the good points.

100
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,000
You just pick up the person with very good points.

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:35,600
I see, so once you see that with this state in love this and you start enjoying another

102
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
person, you start enjoying everything that is there.

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:49,680
And a small blade of grass, you can enjoy.
